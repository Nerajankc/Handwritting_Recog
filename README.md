- Streamlit for creating web applications.
- And many more listed in the `requirements.txt`.

## Setup and Installation ⚙️

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Handwriting_Recognition_Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   - For Docker:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```
   - Directly using Python:
     ```bash
     python src/main.py
     ```

## Usage 🚀

- **Training**: Use the `train_and_inference.ipynb` notebook to train the model with your dataset.
- **Inference**: Run `server.py` to start the server and use the model for inference on new data.
- **Web Interface**: Use `app.py` to interact with the model through a web interface.

## Additional Insights 🌟

- **Scalability**: The use of Docker ensures that the application can be easily scaled and deployed across different environments without compatibility issues.
- **Extensibility**: The modular structure of the codebase allows for easy extension and integration of new features or models.

## Model Training 🏋️‍♂️

The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras. Below is a simplified example of how the training process is set up:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define the model architecture
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 32, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
```

This code snippet provides a basic structure for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwriting recognition. You can customize the architecture and parameters to suit your specific dataset and requirements.
